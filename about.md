# From QA to Docs: Why I Built This Portfolio

For nearly two decades, I’ve worked in QA, automation, DevOps, and Agile leadership — often sitting at the intersection of testing, infrastructure, and engineering delivery. I’ve built test frameworks from scratch, helped mature CI/CD pipelines, and mentored developers and testers in automation strategy. I’ve been the person teams come to when something breaks in production — or when they can’t figure out what exactly the documentation meant.

Somewhere along the way, I realized I didn’t just enjoy building stable systems — I enjoyed **explaining how they worked** even more.

## The Writing Was Always There

Every role I held involved writing: onboarding guides, test strategy docs, internal wikis, technical audits, CI pipeline walkthroughs, sprint newsletters, and architectural notes. I didn’t call it "technical writing" at the time — I just wanted my teams to move faster without tripping over poor documentation or unclear expectations.

As I leaned further into developer experience and platform support, I noticed how much value clear, concise documentation brought to distributed teams. Great tools still fail if the docs are vague. Good engineers still burn out if the processes are opaque.

Writing became the thing that made everything else smoother.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

This site is a reflection of that pivot — from QA Engineer to Technical Writer and Developer Experience contributor.

I created it to showcase a few of the ways I think about communication in technical contexts:

* **Clarity first.** Technical writing isn’t about sounding smart. It’s about removing ambiguity.
* **Context matters.** Writing a CI/CD guide isn’t just listing steps — it’s understanding the developer’s mental model and removing friction.
* **Docs as infrastructure.** Like good test automation, good documentation scales with the team and survives change.

Whether I’m documenting a test harness, a deployment pipeline, or a VPN setup — I’m thinking about the person reading it after a long day, with a bug to fix and no time to guess.

## What’s Next

I’m open to roles in technical writing, platform documentation, or developer enablement — ideally in async-friendly, engineering-led teams that care about clarity.

This portfolio is just a starting point. More samples will follow, including:

* Internal dev guides
* API reference walkthroughs
* Infrastructure onboarding docs
* Open source contribution notes

Thanks for visiting.
