    "title": "From QA to Docs: Why I Built This Portfolio",
    "content": "For nearly two decades, I‚Äôve worked in QA, automation, DevOps, and Agile leadership, often sitting at the intersection of testing, infrastructure, and engineering delivery. I‚Äôve built test frameworks from scratch, helped mature CI/CD pipelines, and mentored developers and testers in automation strategy. I‚Äôve been the person teams come to when something breaks in production or when they can‚Äôt figure out what exactly the documentation meant. Somewhere along the way, I realized I didn‚Äôt just enjoy building stable systems, I enjoyed explaining how they worked even more. ",

    "title": "The Writing Was Always There",
    "content": "Every role I held involved writing: onboarding guides, test strategy docs, internal wikis, technical audits, CI pipeline walkthroughs, sprint newsletters, and architectural notes. I didn‚Äôt call it ‚Äútechnical writing‚Äù at the time, I just wanted my teams to move faster without tripping over poor documentation or unclear expectations. As I leaned further into developer experience and platform support, I noticed how much value clear, concise documentation brought to distributed teams. Great tools still fail if the docs are vague. Good engineers still burn out if the processes are opaque. Writing became the thing that made everything else smoother. ",

I created it to showcase a few of the ways I think about communication in technical contexts: . | Clarity first. Technical writing isn‚Äôt about sounding smart. It‚Äôs about removing ambiguity. | Context matters. Writing a CI/CD guide isn‚Äôt just listing steps, it‚Äôs understanding the developer‚Äôs mental model and removing friction. | Docs as infrastructure. Like good test automation, good documentation scales with the team and survives change. | . Whether I‚Äôm documenting a test harness, a deployment pipeline, or a VPN setup - I‚Äôm thinking about the person reading it after a long day, with a bug to fix and no time to guess. ",
